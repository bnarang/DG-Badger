# DG-Badger

a little program to write a large graph (an edgelist, to be precise) to a badger database. The graph is created based on a desired degree distribution, 
which could be learned from data.

The graph generation is based on a naive implementation of "An Efficient and Scalable Algorithmic Method for Generating Largeâ€“Scale Random Graphs" by Alam et al. (2016).
